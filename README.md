Source Code for [my personal website](https://pranaviyer.com). Built using Django.

Most of the code here is for personal web apps that only I use, and so is not visible without logging in. For more information, see below. 

## Grocery Lists

A simple list application which stores an easy-to-edit list of items, and then transitions into a "shopping" mode which turns into an auto-sorting checklist for easy use in-store.

## Reminders

An email-based reminder service that can schedule custom email reminders to be sent at a later time. Integrates with the To-Do application to allow reminders to be created automatically from outstanding To-Do items.

## To-Dos

To-Do list application which tracks outstanding tasks. Integrates with Reminders application above.

## Pixel Art

Pixel-painting relaxation game. A pixelated image is numbered, with each number corresponding to a particular color. Fill in all of the colors to complete the picture. Includes progress saving per user, as well as a custom editor for generating levels based on any image. [Try the demo!](https://pranaviyer.com/pixelart/demo/)

## Recipe Journal

A recipe-tracking application. Recipes can be saved as raw text, a series of images, or as a URL pointing to a recipe. Once a recipe is added to the collection, multiple notes can be added at different times to track different iterations of the same recipe.

## Budget Tracker

Budget tracking application that allows categorizing transactions into custom categories, setting monthly budget targets, and viewing progress towards spending goals.

## Calendar

Stores events and displays a weekly schedule in an easy-to-understand format. Can handle complex recurring schedules for events, based on time intervals, or days of the week.
